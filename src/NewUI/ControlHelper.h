/**
 * This class is the glue between the GUI and the Control tree. It will send out qt events whenever
 * the controls value is changed, and it can also change the controls value by calling setvalue.
 *
 * In the UI files, widgets may set custom properties "controlId" and "absoluteControlId". These
 * specify what control they should be connected to in an hierarchical fashion. There are basically
 * two ways to use this:
 * (1) a widget has a absoluteControlId set. It will simply be connected to this control
 * (2) a widget has controlId set, and a parent (or a parent's parent etc) has absoluteControlId
 *     set. the widget will be connected to the first absoluteControlId + a concatenation of the
 *     controlId's of the parent widgets. Example: a window has absoluteControlId = "Master.Synth",
 *     a panel in this window has controlId = "Filter", and a widget inside has controlId = "Cutoff". 
 *     This widget will be connected to the control with the path 
 *     "Master.Synth.Filter.Cutoff"
 *
 * ControlHelper is used by simply new'ing it in the constructor of the widget that is using it. Upon
 * construction, it will search the parent for hints on what control id it should be connected to,
 * and after that generally just stay in the background until events come and go.
